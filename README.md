# Hotel-Anandas-Data-Analysis-

## Introduction

The project focuses on a restaurant located in Chennai. The business is B2C and deals in the
segment of dining and culinary experiences. Hotel Ananda, is a restaurant known for its authentic
cuisine.It was started in the year of 1989 which means it has around 35 years of great service and
hotel management. It is known for its authentic south Indian cuisine and it even got more popular
when they introduced North Indian and Chinese cuisine. The major business issues faced by this
hotel are that it has seasonal fluctuation â€“ During holidays/ weekends the sales are going high and
because of which few customers go empty handed and inventory management - Customers are
buying only certain types of dishes and due to this the remaining dishes are getting wasted.

## Expectation 

The expected outcome helps the organization plan accordingly which helps increase the
profitability of the organization. By leveraging analysis and data-driven insights, we can make
strategic decisions to address seasonal fluctuations more effectively and optimize hotel's
performance throughout the year. The project proposal presents a comprehensive roadmap for
success, highlighting the importance of data-driven decision-making and customer-centric
approaches in the restaurant industry.

## Methodology 

The issues will be addressed by analyzing historical data analysis, demand forecasting, customer
segment analysis, top dishes bought, and top combinations of dishes bought. 1 month sales data
for one of the branches is used to analyze the trends. To get the data, I connected with the
manager and with his permission, the data was made used for this project. Main analysis will be
around finding the temporal trends where the revenue generated is highest and changing the
inventory planning accordingly. The second issue will be solved by finding the least and most sold
items and combining these 2 will help in reducing the wastage.

## Platforms used

All the analysis was made using pyspark and pandas. For this colab notebook was made use and
the notebook link is also attached in the report for reference. A power BI dashboard and power
point presentation is also included for easy data understanding.
